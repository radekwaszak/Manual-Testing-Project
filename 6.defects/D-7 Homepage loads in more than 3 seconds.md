**Suggested Fix:** 

* Optimize server response times; review server-side performance and database queries.  
* Reduce asset load; compress large images, minify CSS and JavaScript files, and enable lazy loading for non-critical assets.  
* Optimize third-party scripts: identify and minimize external resources causing delays (e.g., fonts, analytics, or ads).  
* Implement caching: use browser caching and CDN caching to improve resource delivery speeds.
